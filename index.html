    <h1>5 Fun Facts About Computer Science</h1>

    <h2>Ada Lovelace, the First Programmer</h2>
    <p>Ada Lovelace, a mathematician, is recognized as the world's first computer programmer. She wrote the first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine, for Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine.</p>

    <h2>Birth of the World Wide Web</h2>
    <p>The World Wide Web, as we know it today, was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989. He developed the first web browser, the first web server, and laid the foundation for the first website, which went live on August 6, 1991.</p>

    <h2>Grace Hopper and the First "Bug"</h2>
    <p>Grace Hopper, a computer scientist and United States Navy rear admiral, coined the term "bug" in computing. In 1947, she found an actual moth causing problems in the Harvard Mark II computer, thus coining the term "debugging" to describe the process of fixing computer glitches.</p>

    <h2>The QWERTY Keyboard Layout</h2>
    <p>The QWERTY keyboard layout, which is commonly used today, was designed in 1873 by Christopher Latham Sholes, a newspaper editor and printer. It was created to prevent jamming on early mechanical typewriters by placing commonly used letters apart from each other.</p>

    <h2>The Birth of the Bit</h2>
    <p>The concept of a "bit" (binary digit) was introduced by Claude Shannon in his 1937 master's thesis, "A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits." Shannon's work laid the foundation for digital circuit design theory and information theory.</p>
